## Step 1: Download Required Files
Use downloader.py to automatically download all necessary files, such as:

- Pre-trained model files
- Label files
- Other required assets...

## Step 2: Set up Utility Functions
utils.py contains a variety of essential functions that support and enhance the projectâ€™s operations

## Step 3: User Interface
Run ui.py to start the user interface (the functions in utils.py will be used here)
This will open a Streamlit web application, allowing users to easily interact with the model

## Additional Notes:
- config.py stores the paths to the label and data files. (Update these paths to match the file locations on your local device)
